# Homeworks

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment [https://classroom.github.com/a/tm3CNU1h](https://classroom.github.com/a/tm3CNU1h). The assignment will be used for **all** homeworks in this school year.

2. Create a **subfolder for each homework**.

3. If you want to claim extra points for your homework, you have to create a GitHub issue and mention me there (e.g. *@rstropek, I have solved all requirements and want the 2 extra points*).
