# The Adventurer (Part 2)

## Introduction

Now that you have [created the backend](readme.md), you can continue with the frontend for the *dungeon builder*. Game designers should be able to use your frontend to create rooms, connect them via doors, add magic items, and add monsters.

## Dungeon Builder Requirements

You have to **implement a web UI** with which game designers can setup a dungeon.

A skeleton for the UI has already been implemented (see [starter solution](DndLightStarter)). It contains all the HTML and the basic TypeScript structure for the Angular app. You job is to add the missing pieces in [*room-list*](DndLightStarter/DndLight.UI/src/app/room-list), [*add-room*](DndLightStarter/DndLight.UI/src/app/add-room), and [*edit-room*](DndLightStarter/DndLight.UI/src/app/edit-room).

## Exam Simulation

If you manage to build a working version of the required web UI within approx. 3 hours, you are well prepared for the next exam. In order to reach a positive grade, you should at least be able to build a working [*room-list*](DndLightStarter/DndLight.UI/src/app/room-list) and [*add-room*](DndLightStarter/DndLight.UI/src/app/add-room)-functionality within 3 hours.

## Done?

Have you completed this exercise? **Compare your solution with the [sample solution](DndLight) and pay special attention to the comments in the sample solution!**.

You can earn up to two extra points by adding a UI for the *game setup*-related web APIs. If you did that and you think you earn extra points, inform me via GitHub issue.
